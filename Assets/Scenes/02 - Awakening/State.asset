    up. Lying on the muddy ground, your knee is scratched.\nAs you get up, you find\r
    yourself in the middle of a forest, everything seems so foreign. Your memory\r
    is still hazy, something must have happened to you, you probably fell and lost\r
    consciousness. \nNow more awake, you decide to investigate around and find a way\r
    out of here.\r\n\n1 - continue"
