  storyText: "As you exit the forest, you reach a torrent. The flow is strong... dangerously
    strong. \r\nYou notice a bridge, or rather what remains of a bridge, Last night's
    rain was probably more a storm than a drizzle actually. The water probably broke
    the bridge then.\r\nThen, as you look on the other side, you notice people and
    recognise your friends! After calling them a few times, they hear you over the
    noise of the water.\r\nIt becomes clear that your only way out is to cross this
    torrent.\r\n\r\nYou choose to:\r\n1 - try swimming across the torrent\r\n2 - go
    back up the path"
