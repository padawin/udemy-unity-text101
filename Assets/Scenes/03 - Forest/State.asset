  storyText: "The still muddy ground seems to indicate a recent rain. \nAlthough the
    trees are dense, you can see a bit the sunlight and the sun is quite low in the
    sky, it seems to be mid-morning. \nThe forest seems unspoilt, many bushes are
    scattered around, and you hear many birds singing. \nYou are standing on a slope,
    there is a path nearby. You also spot a metallic structure with a cable attached
    to it, like some kind of zipline.\r\n\r\nYou choose to:\r\n1 - follow the path
    uphill\r\n2 - follow the path downhill\r"
