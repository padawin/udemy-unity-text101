  storyText: "The cabin seems in a very good state, probably regularly in use. As
    you look around, you see a pile of wooden logs, an axe is stuck in one of them.\r
    There are also a few pots with flowers and vegetables planted.\r You look inside
    the cabin, it looks empty.\r\nThe door of the cabin is locked, maybe the key you
    found can be used to open the door...\r\nAs you walk around the house, you see
    a similar structure as the zipline you saw in the forest, could it be the same
    one?\r\n\r\nYou choose to:\r\n1 - try to use the key on the door\n2 - go back
    in the clearing\r\n3 - use the zipline"
