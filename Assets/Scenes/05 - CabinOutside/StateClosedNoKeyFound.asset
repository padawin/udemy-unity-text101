  storyText: "The cabin seems in a very good state, probably regularly in use. As
    you look around, you see a pile of wooden logs, an axe is stuck in one of them.\r
    There are also a few pots with flowers and vegetables planted.\r You look inside
    the cabin, it looks empty.\r\nThe door of the cabin is locked, maybe the key is
    hidden somewhere...\r\nAs you walk around the house, you see a similar structure
    as the zipline you saw in the forest, could it be the same one?\r\n\r\nYou choose
    to:\r\n1 - search for the key\n2 - go back in the clearing\r\n3 - use the zipline"
