  storyText: "You are reaching a clearing. The grass is softly dancing with the breeze.
    Some flowers can be seen, scattered among the grass. \r\nMost of the clearing
    is surrounded by the forest, except one side where a tall cliff starts, dark,
    tall like a skyscraper.  \r\nAt the rim of the clearing you see a wooden cabin,
    similar to those used by Canadian lumberjacks.\r\nYou also see the path entering
    the forest, losing itself in the darkness of the woods.\r\n\r\nYou choose to:\r\n1
    - go back in the woods\r\n2 - go to the wooden cabin"
