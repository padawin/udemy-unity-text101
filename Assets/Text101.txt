# Starting state

The wind in the branches. This is the first sound you hear as you wake up. Lying on the muddy ground, your knee is scratched. As you get up, you find yourself in the middle of the forest, everything seems so foreign. Your memory is still hazy, something must have happened to you, you probably fell and lost consciousness. Now more awake, you decide to investigate around and find a way out of here.

1 - Forest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A - Forest

The still muddy ground seems to indicate a recent rain. Although the trees are dense, you can see a bit the sunlight and the sun is quite low in the sky, it seems to be mid-morning. The forest seems unspoilt, many bushes are scattered around, and you hear many birds singing.  You are standing on a slope, there is a path nearby. You also spot a metallic structure with a cable attached to it, like some kind of zipline.

You choose to:
1 - follow the path uphill
2 - follow the path downhill
3 - try to use the cable to reach the high end of the zipline

2 -> C (Stream)
3 -> Fail
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# B - Clearing

You are reaching a clearing. The grass is softly dancing with the breeze. Some flowers can be seen, scattered among the grass.  
Most of the clearing is surrounded by the forest, except one side where a tall cliff starts, dark, tall like a skyscraper.  
At the rim of the clearing you see a wooden cabin, similar to those used by Canadian lumberjacks.
You also see the path entering the forest, losing itself in the darkness of the woods.

You choose to:
1 - go back in the woods
2 - go to the wooden cabin


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 -> A (Forest)
2 -> D (Cabin)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# C - Torrent

As you exit the forest, you reach a torrent. The flow is strong... dangerously strong. 
You notice a bridge, or rather what remains of a bridge, Last night's rain was probably more a storm than a drizzle actually. The water probably broke the bridge then.
Then, as you look on the other side, you notice people and recognise your friends! After calling them a few times, they hear you over the noise of the water.
It becomes clear that your only way out is to cross this torrent.

You choose to:
1 - try crossing stream
2 - use the rope to cross the bridge (If has rope, wins, otherwise drowns and loses)
3 - go back up the path
