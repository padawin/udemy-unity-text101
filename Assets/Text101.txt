# A - Forest

The wind in the branches. This is the first sound you hear as you wake up. Lying
on the muddy ground, your knee is scratched.
As you get up, you find yourself in the middle of the forest, everything seems
so foreign. Your memory is still hazy, something must have happened to you, you
probably fell and lost consciousness.
Now more awake, you decide to investigate around and find a way out of here.

The still muddy ground seems to indicate a recent rain. Although the trees are
dense, you can see a bit the sunlight and the sun is quite low in the sky, it
seems to be mid-morning. The forest seems unspoilt, many bushes are scattered around, and you hear many
birds singing.
You are standing on a slope, there is a path nearby. You also spot a metallic
structure with a cable attached to it, like some kind of zipline.

You choose to:
1 - follow the path uphill
2 - follow the path downhill
3 - try to use the cable to reach the high end of the zipline

# B - Clearing

You are reaching a clearing. The grass is softly dancing with the breeze. Some
flowers can be seen, scattered among the grass.
Most of the clearing is surrounded by the forest, except one side where a tall
cliff starts, dark, tall like a skyscraper.
At the rim of the clearing you see a wooden cabin, similar to those used by
Canadian lumberjacks.
You also see the path entering the forest, losing itself in the darkness of the
woods.

You choose to:
1 - go back in the woods
2 - go to the wooden cabin
