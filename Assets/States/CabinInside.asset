  storyTitle: Inside the cabin
  storyText: "The cabin is old, but well maintained. Many objects of all kind are
    scattered about and around. Pots, blankets, food boxes, even some books. \nYou
    see some heads of stuffed animals too, and the place for a rifle on the wall,
    but the weapon is not here, and neither is its owner. This thought triggers some
    cold sweat in you, but you quickly gather yourself and carry on observing. \nOn
    a chair you see a rope, it seems like those kind of climbing ropes, about a centimeter
    thick and very sturdy.\n\nYou choose to:\n1 - leave the cabin\n2 - take the rope"
