  storyTitle: You won
  storyText: 'You make a loop with the rope and throw it across the torrent, aiming
    at your friend to grab it. After a few attempts, you succeed and each attach your
    ends of de rope on beams from the bridge.

    Once the rope is secured, you engage to cross the torrent, holding the rope tightly.

    You arrive finally on the other side, back with your friends, and who tell you
    that they lost you the day before, as you were hiking in the woods and got surprised
    by the storm.'
