  storyText: "As you exit the forest, you reach a torrent. The flow is strong... dangerously
    strong. \nYou notice a bridge, or rather what remains of a bridge, Last night's
    rain was probably more a storm than a drizzle actually. The water probably broke
    the bridge then.\nThen, as you look on the other side, you notice people and recognise
    your friends! After calling them a few times, they hear you over the noise of
    the water.\nIt becomes clear that your only way out is to cross this torrent.\n\nYou
    choose to:\n1 - try crossing stream with the rope\n2 - try crossing stream without
    the rope\n3 - go back up the path"
