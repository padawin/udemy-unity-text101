  storyText: 'The still muddy ground seems to indicate a recent rain. Although the
    trees are dense, you can see a bit the sunlight and the sun is quite low in the
    sky, it seems to be mid-morning. The forest seems unspoilt, many bushes are scattered
    around, and you hear many birds singing.You are standing on a slope, there is
    a path nearby. You also spot a metallic structure with a cable attached to it,
    like some kind of zipline.


    You choose to:

    1 - follow the path uphill

    2 - follow the path downhill'
