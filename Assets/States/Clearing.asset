  storyTitle: Clearing
  storyText: 'You are reaching a clearing. The grass is softly dancing with the breeze.
    Some flowers can be seen, scattered among the grass.

    Most of the clearing is surrounded by the forest, except one side where a tall
    cliff starts, dark, tall like a skyscraper.

    At the rim of the clearing you see a wooden cabin, similar to those used by Canadian
    lumberjacks.

    You also see the path entering the forest, losing itself in the darkness of the
    woods.


    You choose to:

    1 - go back in the woods

    2 - go to the wooden cabin
