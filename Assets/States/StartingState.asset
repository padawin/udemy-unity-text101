  storyTitle: A rough awakening
  storyText: 'The wind in the branches. This is the first sound you hear as you wake
    up. Lying on the muddy ground, your knee is scratched. As you get up, you find
    yourself in the middle of the forest, everything seems so foreign. Your memory
    is still hazy, something must have happened to you, you probably fell and lost
    consciousness. Now more awake, you decide to investigate around and find a way
    out of here.
