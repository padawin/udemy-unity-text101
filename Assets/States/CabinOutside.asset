  storyTitle: Outside the cabin
  storyText: 'The cabin seems in a very good state, probably regularly in use. As
    you look around, you see a pile of wooden logs, an axe is stuck in one of them.

    There are also a few pots with flowers and vegetables planted.

    You look inside the cabin, it looks empty.

    The door of the cabin is locked, maybe the key is hidden somewhere...

    As you walk around the house, you see a similar structure as the zipline you saw
    in the forest, could it be the same one?


    You choose to:

    1 - search for the key

    2 - go back in the clearing

    3 - force the cabin door open

    4 - use the zipline'
