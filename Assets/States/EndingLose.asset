  storyTitle: You lost
  storyText: 'Slowly you enter the water, the current is very strong and the water
    is whipping your legs.

    You make good progress, but as you reach about the middle, the stone under your
    foot slips and makes you lose your balance. Quickly, the torrent gains over your
    efforts to stay up and you fall, carried away. The last thing you notice as you
    drawn is the horrified looks and scream of your friends, witnessing the tragedy,
    unable to do anything to help you...'
